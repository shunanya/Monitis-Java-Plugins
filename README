The source code of additions to the existing Monitis Java API that allow 
to simply build almost any type of custom monitor are added and described. 
The corresponding examples has been added as well.

Basically, only two classes were added
-	GenericCustomMonitorRunner.java
This class is responsible for adding of a new custom monitor to the existing Monitis monitors scope (if it doesn't yet exist), configure and run it. The necessary parameters and values should be provided by user class that extends the IGenericCustomMonitor abstract class.
-	IGenericCustomMonitor.java
Abstract class that provide all definitions for Generic Custom Monitor. User should extends it for implementing own custom monitor. (see attachments)

The corresponding JAR file was created for new API that was used during tests. 
Note that user should provide only one simple Java class and the desired custom monitor will be created instantly.
Look through the added examples for memcached server custom monitor that could give some more details (package - org/sourcio/monitis/test).
